      <br>
        
      <p class="card-text">Calicut, popularly known as Kozhikode among the locals is a place resplendent with natural beauty, pristine beaches, and historical monuments. This place offers tranquility and the best haven to take a break from a busy life and relax. There are waterfalls like Kakkadampoyil Waterfall and  Tusaragiri waterfalls and also some religious places like Tali Temple, Valayanad Devi Temple.

        Beautiful beaches like Kappad, Beypore, and Kozhikode are perfect spots to spend your lazy days.  Today Kozhikode is the third- largest city of Kerala and draws tourists throughout the year due to its vast tourist attractions and pleasant weather. 
        
        The city is an idyllic place lying between the vast expanse of Arabian Sea on the west and the peaks of Wayanad hill on the east. With so many places to see in Kozhikode, a visit to this famous city is always a memorable one. Good food, friendly people, and above all a great place to explore and enjoy make Kozhikode one of the best tourist destinations of Kerala.</p>
      <p class="card-text">Situated on the Malabar coast and endowed with natural beauty, Kozhikode beach should be a must in the itinerary of your visit to the city. This beach is renowned for the sunsets that tourists throng here to enjoy. Though the water is muddy and not suitable for swimming, still the stunning view of the Arabian Sea that the lighthouse offers more than compensates for the shortcoming.

        Payannakal, Putiyappa, Elathur, Beypore, all these beaches are part of the long stretch of Kozhikode beach. This beach lies on the western side of the city and is easily accessible through the four roads in the city. </p>

                <p class="card-text">Enjoy the breathtaking beauty of Thusharagiri Fall when you pay a visit to Kozhikode.  Two streams originating from the Western Ghats meet at this point to create the Chalipuzzha River. The river further trifurcates to create three waterfalls and the free-falling water creates a mist, thus giving the name “Thusharagiri”.

                    This place has a lovely view all around and you get plenty of activities to indulge in. You may go for trekking, or enjoy rock-climbing. You can also take a break to visit the wildlife sanctuaries or sit on the banks of the river to enjoy the waterfalls. The lush green forest and cool water of the streams all around add to your enjoyment.

                <p class="card-text">Kakkayam Dam is a famous picnic spot around Kozhikode because of its scenic beauty and plenty of choices for outdoor activities. Though the dam is small in size, it more than compensates with the small waterfalls around it. Take a peek at the varieties of animals and birds that inhabit the place. Or take a boat ride along the dam and see the small waterfalls and dense forests that surround the dam. Move around and soak in the scenic beauty of the hills around the dam.

                    There is a hanging bridge on the waterfall which is another tourist attraction.

On your visit to Kerala, you must add this temple to your list of places to see in Kozhikode.   More than a hundred years old, this temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is a must-visit pilgrimage of Hindus. Apart from Lord Shiva, you can worship Lord Ganapathy, the serpent Gods, and Lord Krishna.

                    There is a much widely circulated folklore regarding the temple and its construction by the Maharaja of Travancore. Moreover, the Shivaratri festival is celebrated in much gaiety and fervor here. Apart from that, the moment you arrive in the temple, you will be engulfed by its tranquil atmosphere and both devotees and visitors are welcome inside it. Further, take time to explore the beautiful architecture and some quiet moments near the pond.
