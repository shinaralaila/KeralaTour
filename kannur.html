      <p class="card-text">
        </p>Perched at a height of 286 meters, the Ezhimala hill is one of the most visually appealing Kannur tourist places. The hill is a part of an isolated cluster of hills and the vantage point offers bedazzling views of the sheer naked natural splendour around – hills covered in a blanket of green, cotton white clouds covering the clear blue skies, and the beautiful valley underneath. 

        The place also has cultural and historical significance – the place was a battlefield during the Chola-Chera wars. Buddhists consider the place sacred because it is believed that Lord Buddha visited Ezhimala.

First built in 1903, the place has a history as well as cultural significance. The vantage point offers spectacular and awe-inspiring views of the entire district of Kannur, the vast expanse of the Arabian sea, and the Baby beach.

Tourists can also enjoy a leisurely walk in the well-maintained gardens and enjoy the mesmerizing water fountain show in the evenings.

                <p class="card-text">Located 14 km away from Kannur is the famous pilgrimage site known as Peralassery hosting the holy Sri Subramania temple. The temple is devoted to Lord Subramanya, the son of Lord Shiva and a revered figure in the Hindu religion. 

                    The beautiful idol of Lord Subramania in the serpentine form is one of the main tourist attractions. The temple hosts a gorgeous and majestic pond which is a hotbed for tourists every year. The annual Kodiyettam festival is also a hub for cultural and religious buffs. A visit to the temple will leave you exploring recesses of your soul you never knew you had before.

                    Surrounded by rivers on three sides and the Arabian sea on one side, the island features a brilliant view of the confluence of Anjarakandy and Thalassery Rivers. The canopy of tall coconut trees, the picturesque views of the sea, dense bushes peppered along the beach – all of this makes the island a sight to behold. Take a stroll along the sandy beach and dip your toes into the pristine waters. Experience solitude like never before.
